If you are reading this you are wondering what are ll those doxygen options:

- I need HTML output for the doc at:
http://gdcm.sourceforge.net/html/

- I need the MAN output for the generated man pages, for debian packaging
this is a lintian error when a cmd line tool does not prodivde a man-page.

- I need XML output for the python help page. See also the doxy2swig.py
that is located in Wrapping/Python dir.

- Specify a special FOOTER so that Piwik engine is on and will generate traffic
to sf.net.

The rest of the non-default options is currently not documented...
